------ WHAT SHOULD I EAT ? -------

This little web app is a first approach to answer the often asked question "What should I eat today?". 

Therefore I thought about creating a little program to help me with that question. That was the main idea.

I started to develop the basic functionality with a basic design. Nothing fancy at this point because I wanted to come up with the 
simplest version. Complexity , design and usability will be improved as I proceed. 

----------------------------------

------ BASIC FUNCTIONALITY -------

1) ADD A NEW DISH:

- fill out the required input fields under 'Add a new dish!' and type in the data of your favourite dish
- keep in mind to insert an image-url for the image (you can find some test files at the end of the script.js file)
- the form gets submitted when pressing the 'Add Dish +' button or hitting ENTER on your keyboard

------------------------

2) DISPLAY THE NEW DISH:

- when the form was submitted the new dish is saved and is shown under 'My Dishes'
- that's basically the pool of all your added favourite dishes

-------------------------

3) GENERATE A RANDOM DISH:

- to generate a random dish just press the 'Generate' Button 
- the program will know choose a random dish out of your favorite dishes
- the solution for the question "What should I eat today?" is now answered with just one click 

-------------------------

4) HOW THE DATA IS STORED:

- the whole data is stored in the localStorage of your browser
- to clear it and also the ALL dishes just hit the red button 'Clear All Dishes X'
- I will code up a function where you can delete each individual dish as well!

-------------------------

5) THE POPUP FOR DETAILS:

- if you want to know what the recipe and the ingredients are, check them out in the popup
- the popup is displayed in 2 ways:
  1) click the image of the generated dish
  2) click any image of the saved dishes inside of "My Dishes"
  
--------------------------

----- WHAT I LEARNED : ------

- save data in localStorage 
- retrieve the data from the localStorage
- how to keep the site updated with the elements of the localStorage after reloading the page
- delcaring functions for parts where I'm repeating myself to keep the code clean
- how to work with function constructors
- getting a better understanding of arrays and their methods
- accessing objects and reading their values in a more random way
- there're always solutions for every problem 
- how to use google properly in order to solve a certain problem
